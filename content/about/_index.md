## Who created this website?

Matti Niinimäki  
Senior University Lecturer

## Why does it exist?

- For my students as a one-stop location for the materials for all of the courses that I teach
- For me as a way to plan and develop my teaching
- For anyone who ends up here as a way to learn
- For my TAs as a way to contribute to the teaching materials

## Where is Aalto University?

In Espoo, Finland. Right next to Helsinki.

## This looks pretty cool! How can I become a student?

I teach at the Master's Programme in Art & Media, major in New Media, there are two ways to become a student:

- If you already have a bachelor's degree: Apply directly to our [MA in Art and Media, New Media](https://www.aalto.fi/en/study-options/masters-programme-in-art-and-media-new-media)
- If you do not have a bachelor's degree: Apply first to the [Bachelor's Programme in Design](https://www.aalto.fi/en/study-options/bachelors-programme-in-design) and continue to our MA programme afterwards.
