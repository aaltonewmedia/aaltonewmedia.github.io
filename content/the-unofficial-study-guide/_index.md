## 2022–2024

This is an unofficial study guide for the major in New Media. I used to make this as a Google Doc for the past years, but as I was building this site, I thought I should just have it here with all the other information.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Please note!**  
There are some things that I cannot publish here so I will provide a link to a service that is behind an Aalto login for all sensitive information.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint danger >}}
**Please note!**  
Always check Into, SISU, and MyCourses for all official information. I try to keep this up-to-date but the information here is more grassroots level information that tries to give you some hints on how to survive and thrive in your studies.

</div>

#### Alternative Major Studies (21 ECTS)

As your alternative studies, you should choose a total of 21 ECTS of courses. This means that you choose two 6 ECTS courses and one 9 ECTS course.

{{< hint warning >}}
**Please note!**  
You can include these courses in your Elective Studies also in case you want to take more than just the mandatory amount.
{{< /hint >}}

<div class="calendar">

| Alternative major studies | choose 12 ECTS |
| --- | --- |
| Physical Computing | 6 ECTS |
| Embodied Interaction| 6 ECTS |
| Systems of Representation: Culture Lab | 6 ECTS |
| Generative and Interactive Narratives | 6 ECTS |
| Internet Technologies and Web Development | 6 ECTS |
| Digital Fabrication I | 6 ECTS |
| Digital Fabrication II | 6 ECTS |

</div>

The 9 ECTS courses below are scheduled for Periods IV and V (at the end of your first year). Think of this as a *capstone project* for your first year of studies. 

<div class="calendar">

| Alternative major studies | choose 9 ECTS |
| --- | --- |
| Art + Media Studio | 9 ECTS |
| Digital Fabrication Studio | 9 ECTS |
| Internship and Professional Experience| 9 ECTS |
| Study Project | 9 ECTS |

</div>

The most common choice would be the **Art + Media Studio** that offers multiple thematic groups from the three majors that co-teach this course (New Media, VCD and ViCCA). The groups vary a little bit each year. From the New Media side, Matti is teaching a group called **Audiovisual Studio** and Markku has a group with the title **Digital Culture Research Project**.

**Digital Fabrication Studio** would be the one to choose for students who took Digital Fabrication I and II and wish to fully complete the Digital Fabrication program which is based on [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/).

It is also possible to use the 9 ECTS doing an internship during the spring or summer. Please talk to Matti or Markku about this before you start the internship to agree on the terms for the credits using the **Internship and Professional Experience** course code.

Sometimes we also have some larger projects that we cannot predict beforehand. In theses cases we might open some opportunities for **Study Projects**. You can also initiate an Independent Study Project, but please talk to Matti or Markku about those before you start planning it so that we can agree on the workload and the content of the projects.

#### Elective Studies (30 ECTS)

You can freely choose 30 ECTS of elective studies. The courses listed below are suggestions and recommendations, but you are not limited to choose from just these courses.

{{< hint info >}}
**Please note!**  
The recommended time to do most of your Elective Studies is during the autumn semester of your 2nd year.

{{< hint info >}}
**Please note!**  
I have listed many of the courses under the minors, but you are not required to take a full minor. You can also just select individual courses.
