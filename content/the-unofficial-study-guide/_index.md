# The Unofficial Study Guide for New Media 2022-2024

---

This is an unofficial study guide for the major in New Media. I used to make this as a Google Doc for the past years, but as I was building this site, I thought I should just have it here with all the other information.

**Please note!**  
There are some things that I cannot publish here so I will provide a link to a service that is behind an Aalto login for all sensitive information.

**Please note!**  
Always check Into, SISU, and MyCourses for all official information. I try to keep this up-to-date but the information here is unofficial, grassroots level information that tries to give you some hints on how to survive and thrive in your studies.
