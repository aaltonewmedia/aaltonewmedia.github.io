Welcome! You have found your way to a website that hosts all of the course materials for courses taught by Matti Niinimäki at Aalto University.

This entire website is open source, you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/learn.newmedia.dog).

You can be part of developing this website in the following ways:

- **Found something incorrect?** Post an [issue](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/learn.newmedia.dog/issues) on GitHub—or even better—fix it and create [a pull request](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/learn.newmedia.dog/pulls).
- **Does that feel too technical?** You can also just create [a discussion topic](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/learn.newmedia.dog/discussions) and post comments and suggestions.
- **You don't have a GitHub account?** Just post something on a Telegram Group I'm part of or preferrably on the Aalto Media Lab Discord.
- **Still too geeky?** Just come and talk to me when you see me or send me an email.
