# VisionOSC

---

Send (almost) all Apple Vision Framework's detection results via OSC. (You can pick which one(s) to detect & send). Written in openFrameworks using Objective-C++. macOS 11+ only.

This application does all the heavy-lifting for you and sends the tracking data as OSC to any software that is able to receive OSC.
