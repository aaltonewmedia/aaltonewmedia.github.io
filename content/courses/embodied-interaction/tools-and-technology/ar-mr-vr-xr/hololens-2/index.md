## Unity + Hololens 2

I have successfully been able to follow this tutorial to create a Unity project that runs on the Hololens 2:

- [Introduction to the Mixed Reality Toolkit-Set Up Your Project and Use Hand Interaction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/learn-mrtk-tutorials/)

{{<hint danger>}}
**Use Unity version 2020.3.46f1**

The 2021 version would always crash when I tried to run it on the Hololens.
