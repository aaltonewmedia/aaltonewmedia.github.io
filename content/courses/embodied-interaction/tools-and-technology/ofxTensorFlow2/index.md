This is an openFrameworks addon for the TensorFlow 2 ML (Machine Learning) library. The code has been developed by the ZKM | Hertz-Lab as part of the project [The Intelligent Museum](https://github.com/zkmkarlsruhe/ofxTensorFlow2#the-intelligent-museum).

If you like to use openFrameworks, this might be an interesting option for you to explore. If you would like to learn the basics of openFrameworks, you can take the Generatice Media Coding workshop.
