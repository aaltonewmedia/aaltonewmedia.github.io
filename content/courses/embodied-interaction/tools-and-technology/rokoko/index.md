## Matti's test notes, February 2023

### macOS (M1) / Rokoko Studio 2.3.1.32

- Rokoko Studio works and is able to connect to and configure the gloves.
- After some time, fingers started to bend weirdly. Only fix seemed to be to make a new project.
- Tried livestreaming the data to TouchDesigner. It seemed to initially work as it was sending the data from an actor on the scene but it freezes when I connected the gloves to the actor.
- I will need to test with a Windows computer.
