# Posenet

---

PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.

PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

## How Can You Use Posenet in Your Projects

### Runway ML

https://runwayml.com/

Runway ML is a very nice tool for experimenting with various Machine Learning models. You can even easily connect the output of one model to the input of another.

Unfortunately, unless you have a Linux computer with a very powerful GPU, Runway ML is going to run very slowly.

### ml5.js - Friendly Machine Learning for The Web

ml5.js is a library that implements various machine learning models in a very friendly way. ml5.js works nicely together with p5.js so the easiest way to get started with it is using the p5.js web editor. See the instructions here: https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/

See below for an example application I made using this library.

### PoseNet for Installations

I haven't tried this, but seems pretty nice

It seems that there was some bug that made it crash, Oskar has a fix:
