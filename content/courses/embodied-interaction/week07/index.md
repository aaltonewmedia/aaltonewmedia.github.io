# Week 07 | Workshop Week – No Class

---

No class this week. Consider taking the [AXM-E0103 Workshop Period 3: Generative Media Coding](https://sisu.aalto.fi/student/courseunit/aalto-CU-1150932530-20220801/completion-methods) course during this week. It introduces [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), a C++ creative coding framework that is a useful tool in your toolkit.
