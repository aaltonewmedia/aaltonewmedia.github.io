# (Incomplete) Timeline of Physical Computing/Embodied Interaction

This is an ongoing attempt to map out some key moments, influential artworks, technologies and other points of interest in the development of what we call Physical Computing or Embodied Interaction at the New Media major at Aalto.

It is important to note that this is very incomplete and gets updated on a very random basis (basically whenever Matti feels like writing some things down). It is also created from the perspective of the Aalto Media Lab and includes things that might not be internationally as signifigant as they might be inside Aalto. I appreciate any suggestions or additions from a more diverse perspective.
