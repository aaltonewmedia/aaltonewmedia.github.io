# Final project proposal (March 15, 2023)

---

Create a project proposal for your final project. Think of this as a constantly evolving document where you take notes on your final project ideas. This deadline is for the first version of this.

- Some short thoughts on what you would like to explore and work with conceptually and technically. What is it that you want to create? How do people interact with it? How does it look like? How does it sound like? How does it feel like?
- Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do).
- Initial list of any specific space or technology requirements. How much space do you need? A rough sketch helps a lot.
- Any other references that you have collected. Papers, books, articles, videos, podcasts etc. Keep notes for yourself.

You will present your idea in class on Friday (15/03/2023).

It is ok if your idea changes after this. I am expecting it to change or evolve as you learn more about the topic. **You just need a starting point.**

After this presentation, some of you might also decide to join forces. You can consider this presentation as a way to pitch your idea to other people who could then join you. You should mention if you are looking for someone to work with or if you just want to focus on working on your own thing. **You can also already present your idea with someone else if you have a team.**
