# Final Project: How to get started?

Start thinking about your final project and what you want to do. You have until March 10, 2023 to come up with a project proposal. Start working on it now. Document your process on your website.

Some questions that might help you situate your work?

- Is your project a form of artistic expression? Is it an installation, sculpture, performance, or some kind of other artwork that uses the technology and concepts introduced during the course?
- Is your project interaction or user experience design? 
- Is your project a tool? What does it do? Who is it for? What problem or task is it meant to be used for? How is it different from existing tools?
- Is your project interaction research? Are you interested in creating something that might become a research paper? What is your research aim or question?
- Is your project a game with an experimental interface?

During this course, it is ok to approach the project as an experimentation and exploring of what is possible, but I would like you to consider your work also on a deeper level. What other possible **futures** or **presents** there could be in how we interact with technology and each other? 

Here are some resources that hopefully help you to develop your idea further.

## Inspiration: Speculative Design

## Inspiration: Media Archaeology

Those of you who have been in my other classes should be familiar with the concept of Media Archaeology.

Can you find some obsolete technologies that could inspire your work to create new ways of thinking about speculative futures or alternative presents of interfaces and interaction.

- [Museum of Obsolete Media](https://obsoletemedia.org/obsolescence-decade/)
- [Media Archaeology Lab](https://www.mediaarchaeologylab.com/)

## Inspiration: Science Fiction

Science fiction offers interesting possibilities to think about alternative ways of interacting with technology.

- [Sci-fi Interfaces: ](https://scifiinterfaces.com/) A website that highlights futuristic interfaces in sci-fi films and tv shows. Based on the book [Make It So](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/make-it-so/) 

Yes, watching movies and shows can be part of your research for this course. Even better, organize movie nights to watch things together. Here are some recommendations from this perspective:

- Black Mirror
- Minority Report
- Ghost in the Shell
- Logan's Run
- Johnny Mnemonic

## Inspiration: Chinese Typewriter

What if the develpment of input devices for computers would not have happened in the so-called western world?

This Japanese typewriter is also quite interesting
