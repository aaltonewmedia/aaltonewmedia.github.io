# Final project gudelines

As a final project for Embodied Interaction, you should explore the things you learned and create some form of an interactive system that uses the concepts and technologies that we cover in the class (proxemics, gesture recognition, biosensors, tracking technology etc.).

This outcome can be:

1) Interactive installation
2) A simple game with a novel interface/interaction.
3) New musical instrument/controller
4) Experimental user interface

Please note, if your focus is on the Audiovisual Studio side but you are working on only one project for both classes, you should develop some new type of interface/interaction for either the creation or performing of your work.

## Showcase April 8, 2022

The final outcomes of this course will be shown as a joint exhibition/event with the Embodied Interaction course.

You will present your work in one of the following ways:

1) A livestreamed video work (either real-time or pre-rendered/pre-recorded) on Twitch. The stream starts 18:00 on April 8, 2022. This might happen also at some physical venue, depending on what Matti is able to put together.
2) A work shown at the joint exhibition of AV Studio and Embodied Interaction courses. The exhibition will be in rooms G203, G204 and O102. The exhibition opens on April 8, 2022. Your work can be an installation or some other type of interactive system.

There are also other ways and opportunities for you to show your work. Please consider the following.
