### TouchDesigner Basics

**Those of you who are not taking Audiovisual Studio**, get familiar with TouchDesigner, we are going to use that as our tool for exploring many of the technologies. I will generally also provide code examples and other materials for other programming environments and languages, but the main tool we are going to use is TouchDesigner. Watch at minimum this video:

This video from Ben Voigt explains all of the basic functionality and beyond of TouchDesigner. I highly recommend watching it. We will cover many of these things as we go along, but here are many of the basic techniques all in one video. It is also quite helpful to come back to this one every now and then once you have learned some things already. You will learn many things that you missed the first time you watched it.
