Welcome to Embodied Interaction. This is a course that has been running at Aalto since 2011 (previously named Bodily Interaction). Matti Niinimäki has been teaching this course since 2012. It was originally created by [Ferhat Sen](https://www.ferhatsen.com/)

This year the course has seen some structural changes:
- New course code due to the merger of the Department of Art and Department of Media
- It is now spanning across two periods (used to be 6 weeks inside one period in 2020–2022 and only three weeks before that).
- Hopefully the content improves and gets clearer each iteration.
- More time for theory.
- Many new tools and technologies are available each year (as well as some things become obsolete).

- [MyCourses 2023](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=35386)

## Content

The course presents embodied interaction through lectures, technical demonstrations, and discussions on various related topics. The focus is on creating experimental interactive systems for interactive installations and performances.

The students will explore the topic through readings, small assignments, and a final project presented at the end of the course.

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Develop embodied interactive systems using various techniques and tools, such as gesture recognition, computer-vision tools and biometric sensors.
2. Identify and explain the roles of the body, space, and social interaction in designing interactive experiences.
3. Discuss and apply theoretical frameworks for embodied interaction in their practice.
4. Outline and explain historical and contemporary examples of embodied interaction in the context of interactive art and HCI research.

## Prerequisites

Recommended prerequisites:

- AXM-E7002 Introduction to Media Art and Culture (or equivalent knowledge of media art)
- AXM-E7003 Interaction Design (or equivalent knowledge of interaction design)
- AXM-E7001 Computational Art and Design (or equivalent knowledge of creative coding)
- AXM-E7004 Physical Computing (or equivalent knowledge of electronics and physical computing)

{{<hint info>}}
It is possible to participate in the course without taking the classes above but you will then need to either dedicate some time for independently studying the knowledge and skills that you are missing or bring some other skills to the table within your group.

## Spaces, Studios and Workshops

- We have multpiple spaces booked for the lectures (L208, M101, G203). Please check this site or MyCourses for each week to see where we are.
- For the last four weeks of the course, room G203 is booked for us for working. There will be some Desktop PCs with Touchdesigner installed, projectors, and other equipment for you to use.
- The Media Lab Home Base room O102 is also equipped with a projector, two powerful computers with TouchDesigner installed, surround sound and other equipment. Use that room also for working independently.
- If needed, I can book the room R106 for independent work for you. It has HTC Vive Pro, two projectors, DMX lights, and a powerful computer with TD installed.
- Use vdi.aalto.fi to remotely access the L208 computers with TouchDesigner
- Mechatronics (G014) and other workshops in Väre are available for you to use
- Aalto Fab Lab is available for you to use.
- Book the the Open photostudio whenever you need to use it.

## Tools & Technology

Embodied Interaction is a very hands-on course (especially in Period IV). We are creating novel interfaces and embodied experiences that often require software and hardware design and development. The course introduces you to some specific tools but you are not required to use those specifically for your project. However, this is a list of some of the tools and technologies that we are going to use:

- Touchdesigner | This will be our main software tool. It supports many input devices in a very robust way and allows for fast prototyping of your ideas. You can download a free version of TouchDesigner on your own computer or you can use educational licenses that we have at Aalto in many of the computer classrooms.
- Kinect Azure | This is a depth camera that allows you to detect movement of humans in a space. The Kinect Azure can also be used as an infrared camera for more traditional computer vision techniques.
- Gesture Sensors | You will have access to various sensor that can be used to detect certain gestures. 
- VR/AR devices | For example, the Varjo XR-3 heasdset.

You can also use any other development environments and tools (Processing, Arduino, Unity, Unreal Engine etc.).

{{<hint info>}}
Although there is no strict requirement for any specific tools or technology, your project should still actually work. It should exist as a real thing and not just as a concept. It might have some bugs, issues, and unfinished parts at the end of the course, but it should still be something that we can experience to some extent.

## Deliverables & Evaluation

### Deliverables

You have to do the following to complete this course:

- Actively attend the classes, show up, don't be late, participate, help others. (If the topic of a specific class is already familiar to you, use your time working on your project or in some other constructive way.)
- Complete the [gesture assignment](./gesture-assignment/)
- Complete a [final project](./final-project/)
- Document your learning process and the final project development on a website or some other type of online document. [See guidelines here.](./documentation-website/) You need to keep updating your personal documentation even if you work as a group. Your group can of course share materials and content if needed.

### Evaluation

This course is evaluated 0-5

- 5: Excellent
- 4: Very Good
- 3: Good
- 2: Satisfactory
- 1: Poor
- 0: Fail

You will be graded based on the following criteria

- Active attendance to classes and discussions (25% of the grade).
    - Minimum 80% attendance (being sick or other emergency is a valid reason to not to be present)
    - Your attitude and activeness in class. Please note that this does not necessarily mean being very extroverted and loud. I also appreciate a more introspective and quiet way of working.
- The final project (50% of the grade). You will be evaluated based on:
    - Aesthetic quality of the work
    - Novelty and creativity of the concept
    - Critical approach to the topic
    - Command of the technology
    - Attention to detail
- Documentation of the learning process and the final project (25% of the grade). You will evaluated based on:
    - Critical reflection on your own work
    - Quality of the audiovisual documentation
    - The amount of detail and depth in the documentation
