# Embodied Interaction

---

## Content

The course presents embodied interaction through lectures, technical demonstrations, and discussions on various related topics. The focus is on creating experimental interactive systems for interactive installations and performances.

The students will explore the topic through readings, small assignments, and a final project presented at the end of the course.

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Develop embodied interactive systems using various techniques and tools, such as gesture recognition, computer-vision tools and biometric sensors.
- Identify and explain the roles of the body, space, and social interaction in designing interactive experiences.
- Apply the notion of proxemics to their creative practice.
- Identify and apply theoretical frameworks for embodied interaction
- Outline and explain historical and contemporary examples of embodied interaction in the context of interactive art and HCI research.

## Spaces, Studios and Workshops

- The classes always start in room L208, we will also do some experiments in room G203 (Experimental Studio) each lecture.
- Throughout the entire period, room G203 is booked for us for working. There will be some Desktop PCs with Touchdesigner installed, projectors, and other equipment for you to use.
- The Media Lab Home Base room O102 is also equipped with a projector, two powerful computers with TouchDesigner installed, surround sound and other equipment. Use that room also for working independently.
- If needed, I can book the room R106 for independent work for you. It has HTC Vive Pro, two projectors, DMX lights, and a powerful computer with TD installed.
- Use mfavdi.aalto.fi to remotely access the L208 computers with TouchDesigner
- Mechatronics (G014) is available for you to use
- Aalto Fab Lab is available for you to use.
- Book the the Open photostudio whenever you need to use it.

## Deliverables & Evaluation

### Deliverables

You have to do the following to complete this course:

- Actively attend the classes, show up, don't be late, participate, help others. (If the topic of a specific class is already familiar to you, use your time working on your project or in some other constructive way.)
- Complete the [gesture assignment](./gesture-assignment/)
- Complete a final project
- Deliver a documentation video and write-up of your final project

You have two options for the final project of this course:

- An audiovisual performance done either individually or in a group of 2-3 students. This performance will be livestreamed on Friday, April 8. More details soon. **This is specifically for the people also taking Audiovisual Studio.**
- Creating an artwork/artifact/experience for the combined exhibition of Audiovisual Studio and Embodied Interaction courses. The project for the exhibition can also be done either individually or in a group of 2-3 students. The work should be ready by April 8, 15:00. More details on the exhibition will be added here as things are confirmed.

### Evaluation

This course is evaluated 0-5
