# Gesture Assignment

---

Work together in your group. 2-4 people. Divide into groups during the first week.

Think about the **gestures that you use everyday in your life.** What are some of the most interesting gestures that really take full advantage of your capabilities as a human being.

- Come up with a new gestural interface for some kind of interactive system or experience that uses this gesture.
- It can be an interactive artwork, tool, controller, instrument, object, game etc.
- Don’t think about what is possible technically. You can pretend that it is possible and just works.
- You need to present your interface to the rest of the class. Try to create a mock-up of the interface in any way you can think of.
- For example, the other person is the computer/device the other is the user, act it out, fake it, use props, whatever.
- You can also record this as a video if you want.
- You can also make an actual thing that works, but don’t spend too much time on it. This can be a very rough prototype.
- Present your idea in class on Friday, March 11, 2022.
