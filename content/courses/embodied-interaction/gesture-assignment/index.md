Work together in your group. 3–4 people. Matti will pick out the groups randomly. **Note that this group does not have to be the one for your final project.**

Think about the **gestures that you use in your everyday life.** What are some of the most interesting gestures that really take full advantage of your capabilities as a human being? Are these gestures associated with a specific object, context, or culture?

- Come up with a new gestural interface for some kind of interactive system or experience that is centered around this **one** gesture.
- It can be an interactive artwork, tool, controller, instrument, object, game etc.
- Don’t think about what is possible technically. You can pretend that it is possible and just works.
- You need to present your interface to the rest of the class. Try to create a mock-up of the interface in any way you can think of.
- For example, the other person is the computer/device the other is the user, act it out, fake it, use props, make a fake product-video, do an awkward product launch presentation. This can be very silly and experimental.
- You can also record this as a video if you want.
- You can also make an actual thing that works, but don’t spend too much time on it. This can be a very rough prototype.
- Present your idea in class on Monday, February 6, 2023 and document it on your course documentation site.
