## Lecture â€“ How we got here?

## Showcase

Simon Dreyer was working on the idea of the *cartesian split* between the mind and the body and created [Duo Dimension](https://www.simonarcher.design/accessible-realities).

>Duo Dimension is a two-player game centered on teamwork and designed for a single VR headset. While one player immerses themselves in the digital environment through the VR goggles, the other uses a controller to interact with the same digital space. Together, they create a connection between the digital and physical worlds.

Continue with the video lectures by Jelle van Dijk. This time about Tangible Interaction. Some things that I talked about are repeated but it might be a good recap to hear this from another person with a slightly different angle.
