# Week 03 | Tracking, Project Proposals

---

## Thursday, March 17, 2022

**No class, Matti is in admissions interviews.**

Use the time to catch up on some tutorials or work on your project proposal. Rooms L208 and G203 are available for you to use.

I recommend using this time to go through the blob tracking tutorials.

### Project proposal discussion and presentations

Present your project proposal shortly in class. This presentation has two functions:

1. Get some feedback on your idea
2. Find some people to join your team to work on the same project with you. Or join someone else's team if they are looking for people.

This can be quite freeform and relaxed presentation/discussion.
