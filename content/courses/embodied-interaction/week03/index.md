For the last two weeks we have been exploring in general some different ways that humans interact with technology (and each other). Today we try to go deeper into understanding this topic of Embodied Interaction that has been approached from many directions by different people. 

Specifically, we are going to focus on how the space around you and the objects in that space can become part of your thinking.

Mark Weiser called his ideas **Ubiquitous Computing** in 1988 in the form of computational, networked devices embedded to our surroundings and everyday objects in three different sizes: tabs, pads and boards.

Hiroshi Ishii and the Tangible Media Group call their vision **Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms** since the 1990s. As an example, a more physical or experimental version of the idea of Ubiquitous Computing was explored in the [ambientROOM project](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/ambientroom/).

Saul Greenberg has investigated **Proxemic Interaction** that builds on **Proxemics** by Edward T. Hall and many of the ideas above.

Bret Victor and collaborators are hoping to create a more **humane representation of thought**. The first prototype was called **Dynamicland** or **Realtalk**. Originally developed at the Dynamicland space and right now at [UCSF](https://cmp.ucsf.edu/). 

This talk was your homework:

This is what Dynamicland looked like:

This is what he is doing with it now:
