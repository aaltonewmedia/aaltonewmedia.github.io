# Week 09 | Lesson 02 | 09/03/2023

- [Download the updated mediapipeHands.tox file](../../tools-and-technology/mediapipe/examples/mediapipeHands.tox) This one provides also the 3D coordinates.
- [Download the starting point for today](../../tools-and-technology/mediapipe/examples/tests/mediapipeHands_2D-VS-3D.toe)

We are going to take a look at a machine learning tool called [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/). It is unfortunately not yet installed on the computers at Aalto. So I recommend just following the demonstration today.

Matti will make a video tutorial detailing the use of the tool in the next couple of days so you can come back to it if you wish to use it yourself.
