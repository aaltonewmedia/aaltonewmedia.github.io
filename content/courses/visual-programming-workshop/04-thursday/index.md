## Project

### Outcome

You can approach this project in many different ways. There is no one correct way.

- Start with a clear concept and try to create that vision
- Import lots of materials and start messign around with it and see where it takes you like you be sketching with the code
- Explore some - [TouchDesigner Tutorials]({{<ref "/tutorials/touchdesigner">}} "TD Tutorials") and do a couple of them

Your outcome can be, but is not limited to:

- A video file that you record/render/animate/generate (video art, music video, animation, short film etc.)
- A realtime project that you demonstrate in class
- An installation running somewhere on campus (Experimental Studio, Igloo, in our classroom etc.)
- A short performance that you do on Friday (same locations as above)
- A collection of short experiments during the workshop

### Deliverables

Create a short video recording (1 to 5 minutes). This could be for example:

- Short recording of you VJing with a tool that you built
- An interactive installation
- Interactive sound visualisation
- Short music video
- Experimental animation
- Or anything else that you wish to explore (even a collection of multiple smaller things)
