## Introduction to the Visual Programming Workshop

What is this workshop about? What are we going to do? What am I expecting you to do?

## The Timeline of AV Art

I have been slowly compiling [a timeline of Audiovisual Art here on this site]({{<ref "/resources/av-timeline">}} "AV Timeline"). During this workshop, we are going to go through a selection of some key moments from this timeline. Today, we are going to focus on the time between 1600-1900. Time when magic lantern shows and phantasmagorias were the places where artists were experimenting with projected light.

## Introduction to TouchDesigner

### Learning outcomes

After this session, you should be able to:

- navigate the TouchDesigner network interface.
- identify the key capabilities of each of the operator families in TouchDesigner (CHOP, TOP, SOP, DAT, COMP)
- create, connect, and modify operators.
- use texture operators (TOPs) to modify images.
- use channel operators (CHOPS) to control elements of a TouchDesigner network.

If you missed something in class or just need to recap on these basic topics, [go through the tutorials from Derivative, the company that makes TouchDesigner.](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/)
