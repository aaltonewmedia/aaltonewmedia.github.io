## Homework

### Recap

Go through the course materials for week 1. If you did not understand something we did, go through the examples and tutorials again. Rewrite the code, read through the explanations, try changing things and see what happens.

### Readings

- [Naimark, Michael. First Word Art / Last Word Art. 2001.](http://www.naimark.net/writing/firstword.html)

### Reflect

After reading and watching, consider the following questions:
- Do you see your interest in new media art aligning with some specific area of this spectrum between First Word Art and Last Word Art?
- 

### Assignment

- Use the illustration you created with the 2D Shapes (or make a new one).
- Make it move in some way either by using ```mouseX``` and ```mouseY``` or with ```random()```
- Upload it to our Open Processing class page
