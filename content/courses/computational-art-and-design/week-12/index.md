The rest of the class time is reserved for working on your projects. You can work anywhere, but Matti will be available for tutoring generally only during the class hours. Your attendance is marked as present automatically for these last lectures (except for the last class when you should present your work.)

## Final Project Guidelines

See the [Final Project page for detailed instructions](../final-project/).

## Exhibition or Demo Day

If you want to show your work in the exhibition, please submit requirements for your work [in MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=1111345&forceview=1).

Or if you want to present it only during Demo Day, [fill in the registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNiSdtNJPM0DDRLPgh0RXZrCx99WhK5p8fexa3xEdIfw5jBw/viewform).
