## Content

This course introduces creative coding not just as a tool but also as a creative medium in itself. The course consists of joint lectures for all students and additional excercise groups that students choose based on their previous experience, skill level, and interests.

Topics covered in the course:

- Historical and contemporary examples of computational art and design
- The role of computation in interactive, generative, and immersive artworks
- Fundamental computational thinking
- Data types and structures
- Flow control statements (loops, conditional execution)
- Basics of object-oriented programming
- Best practices (commenting, formatting, structuring)

## Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply their technical knowledge and skills in computational art and design to create artworks, experiences, services, tools, and other creative productions.
- Apply basic programming concepts and techniques, such as variables, functions, flow control, comments, types, objects and arrays.
- Describe, discuss, and demonstrate uses of code as a creative medium.
