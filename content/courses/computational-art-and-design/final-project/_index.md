# Final Project

---

## Guidelines

- Use what you have learned to create a project that explores programming as a creative medium.
- Your project could be a printed image, interactive installation, game, experimental instrument, generative artwork etc.
- Use whatever tools you like. p5.js or Processing are the suggested ones as we have been learning those, but you are also allowed to use some other programming languages. I might just not be able to help you if you decide to use something more exotic.
- Remember “Poems, not demos”.

### There is no specific theme, brief or client?

No, I want you to be able to find your own motivation, goals and ideas. How can programming connect to your existing practice? What is it that **you** want to create?

### I cannot think of anything to do?

Here are some suggestions for simple projects:

- Try to re-create some simple game like Pong, Breakout, Asteroids etc.
- Generative art/design system with an interface that allows you to alter the visual output and save the result as an image. The interface could be digital on the screen or something tangible that you create in Physical Computing.
- A simple data visualization of some dataset that you find interesting.
- [See some examples from earlier years](../showcase/)

### Combined Final Project with Physical Computing?

You can combine the final project of this course to the one you are working on in Physical Computing. For example, you create some type of interactive installation that has a physical interface combined to immersive generative graphics, or you make a simple game with a custom controller...
