## Schedule: Autumn 2023

{{<hint info>}}
All classes are in room H003 at Väre.  
This is a computer classroom in the G floor that is a little bit hidden. You can access it either through the Mechatronics workshop (G014) or the Laser Cutter/Plastics room (H001).

We also use the Screening Room H005 in the afternoons.
