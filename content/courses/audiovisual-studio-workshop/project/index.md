# Project

---

## General guidelines

You can approach this project in many different ways. There is no one correct way. I would just like there to be some form of exploration to **audio** and **visuals**, but you can approach this in many ways. Here are some examples:

- A TouchDesigner project that creates generative visuals based on audio input. Experiment with different parameters that you can control with the different ways of doing audio analysis. I have provided some example files below for specific techniques. [Also explore the tutorials section]({{<ref "/tutorials/touchdesigner">}} "TD Tutorials").
- A short animatated video with music and/or sound.
- You can also use music in the same way as for example Hans Richter did in Rhytmus 21, where music was the inspiration for composing movements in similar ways that you would compose muscial patterns. In this case your actual outcome can be silent.
- You could also create a prototype for an interactive installation that uses sound or camera input for the interaction. This could combine Stable Diffusion as well. For example, an interactive photobooth that applies a Stable Diffusion processing to your camera image.

## Outcome

Your outcome can be, but is not limited to:

- A video file that you record/render/animate/generate (video art, music video, animation, short film etc.)
- A realtime project that you demonstrate in class
- An installation running somewhere on campus (Homebase O102, Igloo, Screen Room F005, in our classroom etc.)
- A short performance that you do on Friday (same locations as above)
- A collection of short experiments during the workshop

## Final Documentation

No matter what form your actual project/process is and how you present it on Friday. I would like to eventually get a video file out this in the end as a form of documentation.

- If you do a performance, record it with a camera and/or using screen capture.
- If you make an installation, document it with a camera and/or screen capture.
- If your project is a real-time generative piece, record a short screen capture of it.
- If you create one linear video, just submit that as it is. You can also provide some making-of footage if you want to.
- You can compile all of your short experiments into a showreel.

You can also add some text, explanations, narration and edit the final video in a more polished way if you can/want to.
