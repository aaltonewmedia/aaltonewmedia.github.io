## General guidelines

You can approach this project in many different ways. There is no one correct way. I would just like there to be some form of exploration to **audio** and **visuals**, but you can approach this in many ways. Here are some examples:

- A TouchDesigner project that creates generative visuals based on audio input. Experiment with different parameters that you can control with the different ways of doing audio analysis. I have provided some example files below for specific techniques. [Also explore the tutorials section]({{<ref "/tutorials/touchdesigner">}} "TD Tutorials").
- A short animatated video with music and/or sound.
- You can also use music in the same way as for example Hans Richter did in Rhytmus 21, where music was the inspiration for composing movements in similar ways that you would compose muscial patterns. In this case your actual outcome can be silent.
- You could also create a prototype for an interactive installation that uses sound or camera input for the interaction. This could combine Stable Diffusion as well. For example, an interactive photobooth that applies a Stable Diffusion processing to your camera image.

## Outcome

Your outcome can be, but is not limited to:

- A video file that you record/render/animate/generate (video art, music video, animation, short film etc.)
- A realtime project that you demonstrate in class
- An installation running somewhere on campus (Homebase O102, Igloo, Screen Room F005, in our classroom etc.)
- A short performance that you do on Friday (same locations as above)
- A collection of short experiments during the workshop

## Final Documentation (Deadline: Friday, November 3)

Submit three things:
1) Video file
2) PDF document
3) Your project files (if you use MyCourses, please upload the files as a.zip archive).

Submit all of these either:
-  in the [OneDrive folder](https://aaltofi-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/matti_niinimaki_aalto_fi/Documents/AVStudioWorkshop?csf=1&web=1&e=rocX21) that we used during the last day of the course if you are ok with everyone in the course being able to access your files **OR**
- in [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=1108490) if you want to send these only to the teacher

### Video

No matter what form your actual project/process is and how you present it on Friday. I would like to eventually get a video file out this in the end as a form of documentation.

- If you do a performance, record it with a camera and/or using screen capture.
- If you make an installation, document it with a camera and/or screen capture.
- If your project is a real-time generative piece, record a short screen capture of it.
- If you create one linear video, just submit that as it is. You can also provide some making-of footage if you want to.
- You can compile all of your short experiments into a showreel.

You can also add some text, explanations, narration and edit the final video in a more polished way if you can/want to.

If you want to use some music, use royalty-free music, so that we are able to publish it without any issues.

### PDF

In addition, please provide a .pdf file that has the following

{{<hint info>}}
 **Mimimum information:**

1) Name of your project
2) 1-2 paragraphs of general description of what your project is about. This is meant as a general description for people to understand what you did. ***If you give me permission to publish your documentation video, this will be public together with the video.***
3) List of external resources that you used to create your work. Links to sources for music and audio files, tutorials you used etc.
4) Also answer these questions in the .pdf file:
  - Can we publish the video and the project description on this site [or on the project archive site](https://newmedia.dog/)?
  - Can we upload your video file to the Aalto Media Lab [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/medialabhelsinki) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@aaltomedialab/featured) channels? The videos will be better quality if we can upload them there.
  - In what way would you like us to write your name if you give the permission to publish it?
  - Would you like us to add a link to your website, social media profile, or some other website below the video? Please list any link you would like to have there.
{{</hint>}}

{{<hint warning>}}
**Additional information:**

Your pdf can also include more detailed information:
- sketches, process images, other pictures
- a description and reflection of your working and learning process, what worked out, how would you like to improve further.
{{</hint>}}

### Project files

Also send your TouchDesigner project files including all images, music, videos, data files that are required to run your project. Note that you can submit your files either here on MyCourses OR to the OneDrive folder that we used during the last day of the course. OneDrive folder is accessible by everyone in the class. MyCourses is accessible only by you and the teachers.

{{<hint info>}}
If you upload the files to MyCourses, please make a .zip archive of the files. OneDrive works ok with just the folder as well.
