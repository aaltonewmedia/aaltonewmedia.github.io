# 01 MON | Introduction

## Introduction to the Audiovisual Studio Workshop

What is this workshop about? What are we going to do? What am I expecting you to do?

---

## The Timeline of AV Art

I have been slowly compiling [a timeline of Audiovisual Art here on this site]({{<ref "/resources/av-timeline">}} "AV Timeline"). During this workshop, we are going to go through a selection of some key moments from this timeline. Today, we are going to focus on the time between 1600-1900. Time when magic lantern shows and phantasmagorias were the places where artists were experimenting with projected light.

## Introduction to TouchDesigner

### Learning outcomes

After this session, you should be able to:

- navigate the TouchDesigner network interface.
- identify the key capabilities of each of the operator families in TouchDesigner (CHOP, TOP, SOP, DAT, COMP)
- create, connect, and modify operators.
- use texture operators (TOPs) to modify images.
- use channel operators (CHOPS) to control elements of a TouchDesigner network.

If you missed something in class or just need to recap on these basic topics, [go through the tutorials from Derivative, the company that makes TouchDesigner.](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/)

We are going to need one specific image file today. [Download it here (right-click and save as).](./files/thomas-mann-baynes-rat.jpg)

After this session, you should be able to:

- load and use images and videos in your project
- combine multiple compositing steps for more complex image processing
- create simple interactions with keyboard input
- use simple audio-reactivity to drive animations

### Video tutorials

If you missed something during the class, [you can check out this series of videos I recorded that go through building the entire process.]( {{< ref "/tutorials/touchdesigner/chromatrope" >}} "Chromatrope Video Tutorials")
