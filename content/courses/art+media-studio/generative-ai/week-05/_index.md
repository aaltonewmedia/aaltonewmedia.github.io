## Into 3D

We will explore how to use AI to generate 3D models and animations. We will use different methods to create and manipulate 3D models.

<!-- Recap of some of the ideas and concepts discussed in the presentations. -->

In some cases we can download the generated assests or view them in online tools like the ones below, or use them in Blender or Touchdesigner directly.
