## General Information

You can approach this project in many different ways. There is no one correct way. However, the proejct must be an some exploration of at least two topics covered in the course. The projects could be:

- an interactive installation that uses camera and then processes the image with AI
- a video that uses AI music and visuals
- a chatbot or trained with your own data
- a model trained on your won image or artistic styles and some application of it
- a hyperdetailed large scale image (similar to Where's Wally)

A simple image, or just something too derivate, will not be enough for the project. IT is highly recommended to use the final project to explore something that you are interested in and that you can use in your future work. Also, to think outside the box and try to combine different things that you might already use in your artistic practice.

## Exhibition

The spaces that we have reserved for the project exhibition are:

- Väre V1 Gallery (smallest space, only for small installations or video projections)
- Väre V2 Gallery (larger space, for larger installations and interactivity)
- Väre G203 (available after 28.05)

The exhibition will be open to the public on the 30.05, but we will start the setup a few days before.

## Final Documentation

The deadline for the documentation is **June 14th**.

You should submit the following:

- Video file or video link
- PDF document
- Your project files (if you use MyCourses, please upload the files as a.zip archive).

Submit all of these in [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=1178084)

### Video

Independently of the form of your project, you should submit a video file. Here are some examples of what the video could be:

- If you do a performance, record it with a camera and/or using screen capture.
- If you make an installation, document it with a camera and/or screen capture.
- If your project is a real-time generative piece, record a short screen capture of it.
- If you create one linear video, just submit that as it is. You can also provide some making-of footage if you want to.
- If your project is an image or some text, provide those files as well, and some pictures of those in the exhibition space.

You can also add some text, explanations, narration and edit the final video in a more polished way if you can/want to.

If you want to use some music, use royalty-free music, so that we are able to publish it without any issues.

### PDF

The PDF should include the following:

- Name of your project
- 1-2 paragraphs of general description of what your project is about. This is meant as a general description for people to understand what you did. **_If you give permission to the New Media Lab to publish your documentation video, this will be public together with the video._**
- 1-2 pages of the learning proecess and the evolution of the project. This is not a learning diary but an extended description development process, what would you like to improve, a critical reflection of the project, what was successful? What didn’t go as planned? What did you learn?
- List of resources, references, or inspiration

In addition, please answer these questions at the end of the PDF file:

{{<hint info>}}

- Can we publish the video and the project description on this site [or on the archive site](https://newmedia.dog/)?
- Can we upload your video file to the Aalto Media Lab [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/medialabhelsinki), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@aaltomedialab/featured) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aaltomedialab/) channels? The videos will be better quality if we can upload them there.
- In what way would you like us to write your name if you give the permission to publish it?
- Would you like us to add a link to your website, social media profile, or some other website below the video? Please list any link you would like to have there.
