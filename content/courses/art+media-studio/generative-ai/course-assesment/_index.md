## Absence Policy

The course has a minimum 80% attendace requirement acording to Aalto University's regulations.

We have 75h of contact teaching in this course. The 20% of this amounts to 15h. This means that you can be absent for:

- 2 days out of the 11 Wednesdays and Friday sessions
- If you miss the presentation or introduction day, please let Calvin know in advance

I would not recommend you to use this too often since you will very easily fall behind with what we are doing if you miss more than this.

{{<hint info>}}
Please let Calvin know if you need to be absent more than the allowed 20% for **health reasons** and if we need to make special arrangements due to that.
{{</hint>}}

## Can I somehow compensate for the missed classes if I have to be away for more than the allowed amount?

Yes, you can complete extra work related to the topic that you missed. The amount of exercises you need to complete depends on what you have missed (more complex topics might only mean one exercise, simpler topics might mean more than one).
