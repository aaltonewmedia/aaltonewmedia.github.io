## Project Proposal

## Grant Application

If you are serious about working in the field of art, you need to be prepared to write applications for grants and other open calls. Writing grant applications is a very large portion of the work as a professional artist.

I am asking you to prepare your project proposal for this course in the format of a real grant application. **~~The deadline for this is Thursday, May 9 (this is a national holiday so submit the day before if you plan to take that day off).~~ I'm givin you a bit more time, new deadline is May 14.**

- [Constantly updating list of available funding opportunities available in Finland or for artists living in Finland.](https://www.tinfo.fi/fi/Apurahavahti) Note that the page is only in Finnish but many of the funding opportunities will also have English instructions. Use your browser's translate feature to translate the page and follow the links to the actual websites of the calls.

## Specific opportunities to apply for already as a student

Many grant applications specifically mention that they do not provide funding for projects related to MA studies. **However, you can always apply as an independent artist to those as well. You will have better chances of success after graduating.** 

Additionally, there are also some specific grants that you might want to consider applying as a student.

- [Media Industry Research Foundation of Finland](https://www.mediaalantutkimussaatio.fi/saatiosta/english/) – Provides larger research funding as well as smaller grants for MA theses in the field of media.
- AVEK grants. many of our students have applied and gotten grants from AVEK during their studies as well.
- [For students in the Department of Art and Media, you are able to apply for maximum 800€ for projects or your thesis costs.](https://www.aalto.fi/en/grants-and-awards/department-of-art-and-media-grants)
