## How to Get Started

I would recommend these two videos to get you orientated visually to the things you need to understand when starting to work with VR in Unity.

## Devices

- [Wikipedia: List of virtual reality headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_reality_headsets)
- [VRCompare](https://vr-compare.com/)

### Headset

- [Wikipedia comparison of VR headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_reality_headsets)

{{<hint info>}}
We have the Meta Quest 2 available your use. Some others as well, but no so easily.
{{</hint>}}

### Computer and Operating System for Development

{{<hint info>}}
To be able to have access to all possibilities and features, I would recommend using Windows.
{{</hint>}}

{{<hint warning>}}
Mac is able to only deploy the application to the headset, it's not possible to do real-time testing.
{{</hint>}}

{{<hint danger>}}
Linux is also possible for deployment but it gets a little complicated and probably quite a headache.
{{</hint>}}

## Developer Tool (Game Engine)

There are two main options for developing applications to the Quest 2

- Unity
- Unreal Engine

{{<hint info>}}
You can use either one, Unity is better documented for VR.
{{</hint>}}

## SDK

There are many SDKs (Software Development Kit) for VR. The main ones you could use are:

- [~~Oculus Integration~~](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/oculus-integration-deprecated-82022) Now [Meta XR](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/meta-xr-sdk-all-in-one-upm/)
- [Unity XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.0/manual/index.html)
- [SteamVR (OpenVR)](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/)
- [MRTK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk3-overview/)

{{<hint info>}}
For the purposes of this class, I would recommend using the [Unity XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@3.0/manual/index.html), this is what the video linked on the top of this page will help you setup.

## How to Learn More?

You could consider taking some courses at Aalto that focus more on VR if you are interested.
