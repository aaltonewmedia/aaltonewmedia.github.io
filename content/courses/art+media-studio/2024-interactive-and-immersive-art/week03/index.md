## Fri 10.05. | Guest Talk by Soyun Park, VR Prototyping Basics

### 10:15-12:00 | Optional Workshop: [Soyun Park](https://soyunparrrk.com/about/)  
**(see the link to Zoom from Discord)**

In this talk, Soyun Park will introduce some of her artistic practices, the cinematic and performative works using generative AI for both the medium and the subject. She will thoroughly share her process of ideation, materialisation, and realisation of these works. After the talk, the students will practically learn and experiment with the open source generative AI tool, Stable Diffusion to shape their own images into a new work.

[Soyun Park](https://soyunparrrk.com/about/) is an interdisciplinary artist, designer and educator from South Korea living in The Hague, The Netherlands. She is interested in the relationships between technology and humans, from the individual level such as physical movement and relationships to the social level, architecture and politics.

Often in collaboration, her work takes the shape of films, installations, and audiovisual performances. By making use of new media and technology, her work investigates the border between the digital world and reality which is getting thinner every day. Leading a community-driven studio [RGBdog](https://rgbdog.studio/), she also teaches at educational institutions globally with her passion towards education.

After graduating from the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague (graphic design BA), She has exhibited and performed at media art festivals, cultural venues and film festivals including for example Rewire Festival (NL), Nederland Fotomuseum (NL), Ars Electronica (AT), CTM Festival (DE), Jeonju International Film Festival (KR) and iii workspace (NL). Her co-directed film 'Wunderkammer 10.0' was awarded a Special Jury Prize at the Jeonju International Film Festival in 2022, and she was selected for Faces of We Are Europe in the same year.
