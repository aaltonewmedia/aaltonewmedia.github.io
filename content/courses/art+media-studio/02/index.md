# 05/04: Second Meeting

## Discussion on the gallery visit and the readings

- Did you get the feeling of being immersed in the Monet2Klimt exhibition?
- Were there some things that distracted you from being immersed?
- How did it make you feel or think in other ways?
- What could be other ways to use such large-scale projection spaces in more interesting ways?

This VR experience also had a performative side to it in the form of actors who were present at certain times. Currently, 

The video below has recordings of some of these encounters with the actors. I would recommend playing through it before watching the video to avoid spoilers.
