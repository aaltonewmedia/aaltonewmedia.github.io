## 3D Printing Introduction

We get a proper introduction from Hector on all the possibilities at the 3D print workshop at Väre.

## Laser Cutters at Aalto

### Väre

Väre has two laser cutters that you can use. They are located in room H001 (Plastics and Laser) on the G floor.

#### Epilog Fusion Pro 48 80W

### Aalto FabLab (Otakaari 7)

Aalto FabLab also has one laser cutter. You can find the Aalto FabLab in the Otakaari 7 building.

#### Epilog Fusion Pro 48 80W

Fablab has the same Epilog laser cutter as Väre. You need to complete their introduction session before you are able to book the laser. Even if you have done the one for Väre.

## Working with the laser cutter

All of the laser cutters at Aalto mostly work in the same way. You create vector files with outlines and fills. The software that interprets these shapes

- Create thin outlines for any parts that you want cut out
- Create filled shapes that you want engraved
- You can configure different types of cutting settings using different colors

We are going to only use the Epilog Fusion Pro 48 laser cutter. [You can download the manual for that machine here.](https://www.epiloglaser.com/tech-support/laser-manuals.htm)

The software we use for preparing the final files for the machine is Adobe Illustrator.

### Safety

{{<hint danger>}}
Laser cutters are machines that are basically constantly trying to catch on fire. You have to always stand next to the laser cutter while it is running. Use the pause feature if you need to go somewhere while cutting.

{{<hint danger>}}
There are some materials that you should never use with a laser cutter.
- PVC (polyvinyl chloride): creates pure chlorine gas when burned that is very harmful to you and destroys the machine!
- ABS: Emits cyanide gas and tends to melt
- Leather and artificial leather that contains chromium (VI). Leather that hasn't been chrome-tanned is ok.
- Carbon fibers (Carbon)
- Polyvinyl butyrale (PVB)
- Polytetrafluoroethylenes (PTFE /Teflon)
- Beryllium oxide
- Any materials containing halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and astatine), epoxy or phenolic resins
