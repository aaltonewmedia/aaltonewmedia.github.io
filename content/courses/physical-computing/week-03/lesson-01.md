# Output Devices: Motors, Actuators, Lights

---

## How to Choose the Right Motor or Actuator?

- [Motor guide from Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/motors-and-selecting-the-right-one)
- [Motor guide from Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-selection-guide)

## How to work with motors and other actuators?

I have created tutorials for different types of actuators.

- [Servo Motors](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/motors-and-actuators/servo-motors/)
- [DC Motors](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/motors-and-actuators/dc-motors/)
- [Stepper Motors](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/motors-and-actuators/stepper-motors/)
- [Solenoids](../../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/motors-and-actuators/solenoids-and-electromagnets/)

## Working with addressable digital LEDs (Neopixels)

[I have made a simple tutorial and some examples here.](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/leds-and-other-lights/neopixels/)

Neopixel is a brand name by Adafruit for certain types of addressable LEDs.
