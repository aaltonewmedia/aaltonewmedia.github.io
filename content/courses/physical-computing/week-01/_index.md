## Deliverables for Week 1

### 1. Course Documentation Website (Monday, October 31, 15:00)

Create a course website to document your assignments, final project work and progress during the course. Here are some suggestions:
- Create a blog at [blogs.aalto.fi](https://blogs.aalto.fi/). ***This is the easiest solution.***
- Use your own website if you have one.
- You can use [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), ask Matti for access to educational version.
- You can use [Cargo Collective](https://cargo.site/), ask Matti for a code for free educational license.
- Create a new website as a GitHub page. This is the recommended option if you plan to take the Digital Fabrication courses in the Spring. You can use this course to already practise using git and a static website generator called Hugo.
- **You can also use something like Miro or Google Docs as your documentation. I highly recommend creating a publicly accessible website though so that others can learn from what you do.**

However you decide to create it, send the URL to Matti [using MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=37545&section=1).

[This page has more detailed instructions on the options.](../documentation-website/)

### 2. Arduino Basics (Thursday, November 1, 13:00)

Create a circuit and Arduino code that does the following

#### Circuit
- Connect two LEDs to your Arduino using a breadboard
- Connect one switch to your Arduino using a breadboard

#### Code
1. Read a momentary switch being pressed
2. When the program starts, both LEDs are off
3. When the switch is pressed once, the first LED turns on
4. When the switch is pressed the second time, the second LED turns on (the first one should also still be on)
5. When the switch is pressed the third time, both LEDs turn off
6. Repeat this same cycle of LEDs turning on and off in sequence (off, one LED, two LEDs, off...)

**Document your work on the course website that you created. Deadline: Thursday, November 1, 13:00**

#### Tips
[Check the tutorials on Digital Input from here](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/arduino/)


### 3. Readings

- [Bret Victor: A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)
    - [Responses to the text](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/responses.html)
- [Tangible Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/tangible-interaction)

Adding short reflections of the readings on your site is not mandatory but will have a positive effect on your evaluation and can compensate for missed lectures.
