## Deliverables for Week 1

### 1. Course Documentation website

{{<hint info>}}
For the 2023 course, we are experimenting with a new way of doing the project documentation. Matti has been setting up a website at [newmedia.dog](https://newmedia.dog/) for archiving course work, student projects, and generally as a project documentation site for new media students. All of you will have a way to contribute to this site under your own repository.

I am still figuring out some of the ways this could be done as smooth as possible, so please bear with me if/when there are some hiccups.

I did not have the time to prepare the instructions properly for the beginning of the course, so We will go through this in detail tomorrow (October 24).

[This page has more detailed instructions on the options.](../documentation-website/)

### 1. Arduino Basics (Thursday, November 1, 13:00)

Create a circuit and Arduino code that does the following

#### Circuit
- Connect two LEDs to your Arduino using a breadboard
- Connect one switch to your Arduino using a breadboard

#### Code
1. Read a momentary switch being pressed
2. When the program starts, both LEDs are off
3. When the switch is pressed once, the first LED turns on
4. When the switch is pressed the second time, the second LED turns on (the first one should also still be on)
5. When the switch is pressed the third time, both LEDs turn off
6. Repeat this same cycle of LEDs turning on and off in sequence (off, one LED, two LEDs, off...)

**Document your work on the course website that you created. Deadline: Thursday, November 1, 13:00**

#### Tips
[Check the tutorials on Digital Input from here](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/arduino/)


### 3. Readings

- [Bret Victor: A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)
    - [Responses to the text](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/responses.html)
- [Tangible Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/tangible-interaction)

Adding short reflections of the readings on your site is not mandatory but will have a positive effect on your evaluation and can compensate for missed lectures.
