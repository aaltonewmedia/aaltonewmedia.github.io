## Deliverables for Week 1

### Course Documentation Website

Create a course website to document your assignments, final project work and progress during the course. Here are some suggestions:
- Create a blog at [blogs.aalto.fi](https://blogs.aalto.fi/). ***This is the easiest solution.***
- Use your own website if you have one.
- You can use [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), ask Matti for access to educational version.
- You can use [Cargo Collective](https://cargo.site/), ask Matti for a code for free educational license.
- Create a new website as a GitHub page. See this tutorial for help with a template. This is the recommended option if you plan to take the Digital Fabrication courses in the Spring. You can use this course to already practise using git and a static website generator called Hugo.

However you decide to create it, send the URL to Matti.
