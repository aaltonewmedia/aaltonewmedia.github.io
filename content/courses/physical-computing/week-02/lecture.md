## Deliverables for Week 2: Alt+Ctrl Interface

- Explore at least one sensor in more detail.
- Think of different interactions and/or gestures that could be detected with the sensor you picked.
- Choose an existing video game that could be controlled using the interaction/interface enabled by this sensor. You can also come up with a completely new game/game mechanic.

{{<hint info>}}
Do not make this too complex. Think of simple games and game mechanics.
