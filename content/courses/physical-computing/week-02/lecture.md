The [alt.ctrl.CDG](https://gdconf.com/alt-ctrl-gdc) is a specific category of the [Game Developer's Conference](https://gdconf.com/about) that showcases alternative controllers for games. [The deadline for 2023 submission is on December 2, 2022.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBK8BIvYzLJ8rKx7K8NKNIRvDRIB64Pqs5FUbB6uMcqkW7ug/viewform?MCAID=77FB1CFE532B22840A490D45@AdobeOrg)

### Enric Granzotto Llagostera: Cook Your Way

>This is a game about how immigration systems and capitalist discourses of multiculturalism combine to oppress migrants. Visa applicants (or players) are tasked with cooking a typical dish of their country of origin using a cooking station. Immigration authorities then evaluate applicants according to their efficiency and potential to contribute to the new country’s society. Cooking becomes a standardized test, one step within a longer application process.

## Deliverables for Week 2 (Deadline: Tuesday, November 8, 13:00)

### 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

Explore the archive from GDC:

- [GDC alt.ctrl Archive](https://gdconf.com/alt-ctrl-gdc/archive)
- [Shake that Button](https://shakethatbutton.com/)

Find one interesting project/controller from there and write a short description of the project. Include a link to it and even embed a video to your site if there it is available.

### 2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface

- Explore at least one sensor in more detail.
- Think of different interactions and/or gestures that could be detected with the sensor you picked.
- Choose an existing video game that could be controlled using the interaction/interface enabled by this sensor. You can also come up with a completely new game/game mechanic.
- You don't need to make it work yet. Just come up with the idea/concept for your alternative controller.
- Write about your idea on your site.

Do not make this too complex. Think of simple games and game mechanics.
