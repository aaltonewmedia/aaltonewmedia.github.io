## Deliverables for Week 2 (Deadline: Thursday, November 9, 13:00)

### 1. Find an interesting existing Alt+Ctrl Interface

Explore the archive from GDC, Shake That Button and beyond:

- [GDC alt.ctrl](https://gdconf.com/alt-ctrl-gdc)
- [GDC alt.ctrl Archive](https://gdconf.com/alt-ctrl-gdc/archive)
- [Shake that Button](https://shakethatbutton.com/)

Find one interesting project/controller and write a short description of the project. Include a link to it and even embed a video to your site if there it is available. Why did you choose this? What caught your attention?

### 2. Come up with a concept for your own Alt+Ctrl Interface

- Explore at least one sensor in more detail. Figure out how to read the values from it with your Arduino. Print out the data from the sensor to the Serial Monitor or Serial Plotter
- Think of different interactions and/or gestures that could be detected with the sensor you picked.
- Choose an existing video game that could be controlled using the interaction/interface enabled by this sensor. You can also come up with a completely new game/game mechanic.
- You don't need to make it work yet. Just come up with the idea/concept for your alternative controller.
- Write about your idea on your site.
- You can draw sketches or other ways to illustrate your idea.
- You can also make a prototype if you are able to, but I am not requiring it. It's enough to just describe the concept.

Do not make this too complex. Think of simple games and game mechanics.

When thinking of new interactions, I find it helpful to go to hardware stores, art/craft supply stores, flea markets and other places that have interesting obejcts and materials. Think about how you can manipulate the objects and materials with your hands and how those could be connected to some game mechanics (and what kind of sensor would be needed for that).

### 3. Complete the MyCourses introductions for the 3D Printing and Laser Cutter workshops

- [OT14 3D Print](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=23273)
- [OT14 Plastics & Laser H001](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=19552)

#### Files for 3D printing

We will use class time next week to go print the parts that we need, but if you already have time, you can go and 3D print the sensormount/googly eye holder for our robot. [Check MyCourses for the cost center and project code that you can give at the 3D Print workshops so you don't have to pay for the materials.](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/page/view.php?id=1113688&forceview=1)

- [roboeyes.stl](/files/physical-computing-robot/roboeyes.stl)

If you want to edit the design, you can use this [Fusion 360 file](https://a360.co/479P6xB).

#### Files for Laser Cutting

We will use class time next week to go cut the parts that we need. I will upload the files here in advance so you can already cut them if you know how.

*Matti is still working on this file. Come back later...*
