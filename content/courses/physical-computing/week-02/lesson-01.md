## Sensors with analog output

There are also many sensors that have an analog outpput. Analog in this case meaning that they are directly outputting a varyying level of voltage

## References

There are various sites that list out sensors:

- [Aalto New Media: Sensors tutorials.](../../../tutorials/arduino-and-electronics/sensors/) The tutorials on this site. Specifically focusing on components we have in our kits and otherwise available.
- [sensorwiki.org](https://sensorwiki.org/) by The Working Group on Interactive Systems and Instrument Design in Music (ISIDM)

I find it useful to browse some online shops that sell sensor boards to get an understanding what kind of things are possible.
