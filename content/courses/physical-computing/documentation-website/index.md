{{<hint info>}}
For the 2024 course, we are experimenting with a new way of doing the project documentation. Matti has been setting up a website at [physcomp.newmedia.dog](https://physcomp.newmedia.dog/) for archiving the course work this year.

I am still figuring out some of the ways this could be done as smooth as possible, so please bear with me if/when there are some hiccups.
