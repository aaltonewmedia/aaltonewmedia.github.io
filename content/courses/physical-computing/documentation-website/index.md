# Documentation Website

---

{{<hint info>}}
For the 2023 course, we are experimenting with a new way of doing the project documentation. Matti has been setting up a website at [newmedia.dog](https://newmedia.dog/) for archiving course work, student projects, and generally as a project documentation site for new media students. All of you will have a way to contribute to this site under your own repository.

I am still figuring out some of the ways this could be done as smooth as possible, so please bear with me if/when there are some hiccups.

We will go through this in detail tomorrow (October 24)

## Instructions

### Short summary

1. Login to [version.aalto.fi](https://version.aalto.fi) (use the Aalto Haka login)
2. There should be a repository with your name that I have created. You should have gotten an email invitation to edit the repository.
3. Click on the name of that project. These files are what are used to generate content to the project website [newmedia.dog](https://newmedia.dog/)
4. Edit the files by selecting `Edit-->Web IDE`. This opens an online text editor where you can start editing your files and adding new ones.
5. Replace the image called `me.png` with a new image of you or something that represents you. It will be the featured picture on your section on the site.
6. Edit the `_index.md` file to have some details about you, you can add links to your personal website, social media etc. here if you want to.
7. Edit the files in the `physical-computing` folder for each week assignemnts and final project documentation.
