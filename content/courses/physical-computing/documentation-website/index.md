# Documentation Website

---

{{<hint info>}}
For the 2023 course, we are experimenting with a new way of doing the project documentation. Matti has been setting up a website at [newmedia.dog](https://newmedia.dog/) for archiving course work, student projects, and generally as a project documentation site for new media students. All of you will have a way to contribute to this site under your own repository.

I am still figuring out some of the ways this could be done as smooth as possible, so please bear with me if/when there are some hiccups.

We will go through this in detail tomorrow (October 24)
