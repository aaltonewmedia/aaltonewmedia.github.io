# Final Project

---

## Guidelines

Students should complete a final project, either individually or in a small group (max. 3 students), that explores electronics as a creative medium.

Some common topics that could be good starting points if you are still looking for something to do:
- Tangible user interfaces
- Wearable electronics
- Custom music controllers/instruments
- Synthesizers and sequencers
- Kinetic sculptures
- Simple robots
- Interactive installations 

Additional tips
- Read through Tom Igoe’s post about [Physical Computing’s Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
- If you are still a bit uncomfortable with working with electronics, start from simple and expand from there.
- Browse through the [Critical Making Projects](http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/) and the [Disobedient Electronics Book](http://www.disobedientelectronics.com/) for some inspiration.
- [Check out some projects on Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/)
- [Browse through some Adafruit tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)
- [See some examples from the Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub)

It is ok to combine this project with the final project of the Computational Art and Design course.

## Project Proposal (Deadline: Monday, November 14)

Create a project proposal for your final project. Think of this as a constantly evolving document where you take notes on your final project ideas. This deadline is for the first version of this.

- Some short thoughts on what you would like to explore and work with conceptually and technically. What is it that you want to make? How does it look like? What does it do?
- Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do)
- Initial list of parts and components you think you will need

You will present your idea in class on Monday (14/11/2022). This is a very uninformal presentation and mainly serves as a way for us to discuss your ideas together.

It is ok if your idea changes after this. I am expecting it to change or evolve as you learn more about the topic. **You just need a starting point.**

After this presentation, some of you might also decide to join forces. You can also mention if you are looking for someone to work with or if you just want to focus on working on your own thing.

## Project Documentation

It is extremely important to document your work well. This is not useful just for this course but for your portfolio as well. Your course website should have a dedicated section(s)/page(s) for your final project.

Minimum documentation consists of:

- A short description of your project and reflection on the things you learned (500-1000 words)
- One photo of the finished work
- One short video of the finished work

Recommended documentation also would include one or more of the following

-A guide/tutorial on how to build your project from the technical side. See the [EFA Robot documentation as an example](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/mnstri/the-little-efa-robot-b41959).
- A more detailed report on the process of creating your work.
- More photos, sketches, high-quality video.
