# Final Project

---

## Guidelines

Students should complete a final project, either individually or in a small group (max. 3 students), that explores electronics as a creative medium.

Some common topics that could be good starting points if you are still looking for something to do:
- Tangible user interfaces
- Wearable electronics
- Custom music controllers/instruments
- Synthesizers and sequencers
- Kinetic sculptures
- Simple robots
- Interactive installations 

Additional tips
- Read through Tom Igoe’s post about [Physical Computing’s Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
- If you are still a bit uncomfortable with working with electronics, start from simple and expand from there.

It is ok to combine this project with the final project of the Computational Art and Design course.
