## Guidelines

Students should complete a final project, either individually or in a small group (max. 3 students), that explores electronics as a creative medium.

Some common topics that could be good starting points if you are still looking for something to do:
- Tangible user interfaces
- Wearable electronics
- Custom music controllers/instruments
- Synthesizers and sequencers
- Kinetic sculptures
- Simple robots
- Interactive installations 

Additional tips
- Read through Tom Igoe’s post about [Physical Computing’s Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
- If you are still a bit uncomfortable with working with electronics, start from simple and expand from there.
- Browse through the [Critical Making Projects](http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/) and the [Disobedient Electronics Book](http://www.disobedientelectronics.com/) for some inspiration.
- [Check out some projects on Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/)
- [Browse through some Adafruit tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/)
- [See some examples from the Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub)

It is ok to combine this project with the final project of the Computational Art and Design course.

## Project Proposal (Deadline: Thursday, November 16)

Create a project proposal for your final project. Think of this as a constantly evolving document where you take notes on your final project ideas. This deadline is for the first version of this.

- Some short thoughts on what you would like to explore and work with conceptually and technically. What is it that you want to make? How does it look like? What does it do?
- Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do)
- Initial list of parts and components you think you will need

You will present your idea in class on Thursday (16/11/2023). This is a very uninformal presentation and mainly serves as a way for us to discuss your ideas together.

{{<hint info>}}
It is ok if your idea changes after this. I am expecting it to change or evolve as you learn more about the topic. **You just need a starting point.**
{{</hint>}}

After this presentation, some of you might also decide to join forces. You can also mention if you are looking for someone to work with or if you just want to focus on working on your own thing.

## Course Exhibition and Demo Day

{{<hint info>}}
**Note that this is voluntary. You do not have to present your work in the exhibition or at Demo Day. You can also just present the project during our last day on Friday, December 8**
{{</hint>}}

### Exhibition Dates

{{<hint info>}}
We have the spaces booked from November 30 to December 15. These spaces are going to be shared with the projects from this course and the Computational Art and Design course. Our official opening event will be on December 8, but it's great if you can finish up setting up your work even earlier than that. The dates of our exhibition are a little bit fluid. The first week is more of a work-in-progress where some things might be ready, some things still a little bit under construction.

- Setting up: November 30 to December 7
- Opening: Friday, December 8, 16:00
- Exhibition: December 8–15
- Take down: Friday, December 15 at 15:00
{{</hint>}}

### Exhibition Spaces

We have booked two spaces for exhibiting the work that we have been doing throghout the semester.

- Väre, LQ Lobby
- Learning Centre, Lobby

***Let Matti know about any equipment or space requirements for your work!***

### Winter Demo Day 2023

You can also present or show your work during one day as well at the Aalto Media Lab Demo Day. [Fill in the registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNiSdtNJPM0DDRLPgh0RXZrCx99WhK5p8fexa3xEdIfw5jBw/viewform).

## Project Documentation (Deadline December 15)

It is extremely important to document your work well. This is not useful just for this course but for your portfolio as well. Your course website should have a dedicated section(s)/page(s) for your final project.

Minimum documentation consists of:

- A short description of your project and reflection on the things you learned (500-1000 words)
- One photo of the finished work
- One short video of the finished work. This can be on Youtube, Vimeo etc. or a separate video file you upload to your website.

Recommended documentation also would include one or more of the following

-A guide/tutorial on how to build your project from the technical side. 
- A more detailed report on the process of creating your work.
- More photos, sketches, high-quality video.

**No separate assignment submission to MyCourses, just use the website or online document that you have been using for the course.**
