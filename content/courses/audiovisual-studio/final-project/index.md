# Final project gudelines

As a final project for Audiovisual Studio, you should explore the things you learned and create some form of audiovisual artwork. This outcome can be:

1) A video file
2) Realtime VJ set (use your own music, or royalty-free music so that we can publish it)
3) Realtime AV performance
4) Some type of artwork that will be in our small course exhibition

The work should in some way explore the conection of sound/music and visuals.

## Showcase April 8, 2022

The final outcomes of this course will be shown as a joint exhibition/event with the Embodied Interaction course.

You will present your work in one of the following ways:

1) A livestreamed video work (either real-time or pre-rendered/pre-recorded) on Twitch. The stream starts 18:00 on April 8, 2022. This might happen also at some physical venue, depending on what Matti is able to put together.
2) A work shown at the joint exhibition of AV Studio and Embodied Interaction courses. The exhibition will be in rooms G203, G204 and O102. The exhibition opens on April 8, 2022. Your work can be an installation or a video work.

There are also other ways and opportunities for you to show your work. Please consider the following.
