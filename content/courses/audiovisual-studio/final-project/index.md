# Final project gudelines

As a final project for Audiovisual Studio, you should explore the things you learned and create some form of audiovisual artwork. The work should in some way explore the conection of sound/music and visuals.

This outcome can be:

1) A video file (animation, experimental video work, music vide etc.)
2) Realtime VJ set (use your own music, or royalty-free music so that we can publish it)
3) Realtime AV performance
4) Some type of artwork that will be in our small course exhibition.


## Showcase April 8, 2022

The final outcomes of this course will be shown as a joint exhibition/event with the Embodied Interaction course.

You will present your work in one of the following ways:

1) ~~A livestreamed video work (either real-time or pre-rendered/pre-recorded) on Twitch. The stream starts 18:00 on April 8, 2022. This might happen also at some physical venue, depending on what Matti is able to put together.~~
EDIT: We will postpone the livestream until after you have submitted the final project documentation videos. That way we have more content to show there and we might also have some additional projects from other classes. You should however join the Firday session at 3 pm to present your project. It's ok if it is still somewhat unfinished or unpolished.

2) A work shown at the joint exhibition of AV Studio and Embodied Interaction courses. The exhibition will be in rooms G203, G204 and O102. The exhibition opens on April 8, 2022. Your work can be an installation or a video work.

## Deadline for final project documentation

You have two more weeks to compile a documentation video of your work. Please submit a short video and description of your work to MyCourses. Deadline is Friday, April 22. I will add the link to the MyCourses assignemnt here soon.
