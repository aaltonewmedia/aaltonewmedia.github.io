# Electronics: Fundamentals

## Voltage

[![Voltage](./img/water01.png)](./img/water01.png)

- Symbol: V (U in some parts of Europe, E is sometimes used in the USA)
- Unit: Volt (V)

Voltage is the difference in electric potential energy between two points.

In our water analogy, voltage is like the amout of pressure that has the potential to push the water through a water pipe.

## Current 

[![Current](./img/water02.png)](./img/water02.png)

- Symbol: I
- Unit: Ampere/Amp (A)

Current is the flow of electric charge.

In our water analogy, current would be the water current or water flow. The amount of water that flows in a water pipe.

## Resistance

- Symbol: R
- Unit: Ohm (Ω)

Resistance is the measure of a material’s ability to oppose the flow of electricity.

In our water analogy, resistance is like a narrowing or clog in the pipe that makes it harder for the water to flow through.

## Ohm's Law

[![Ohm's Law](./img/ohms-law.png)](./img/ohms-law.png)

- V = I * R
- I = V / R
- R = V / I
