## Mediapipe + TouchDesigner

TouchDesigner is able to run Python. Therefore, it's also possible to run Mediapipe inside TouchDesigner in order to create interactive prototypes even faster and without having to write all of the code for your experimental project in Python. TouchDesigner allows you to get the tracking data in via Python and then you can prototype using the standard ToucDesigner workflows.

### Aalto Windows Computers

Setting up Mediapipe to work with TouchDesigner on Aalto computers needs to be done in a very specific way. Please follow the instructions carefully.

TouchDesigner comes with Python built-in. The current version is Python 3.9.5 (January 2023, TouchDesigner version 2022.31030). You need to install a matching version on your computer to be able to setup Mediapipe for Python.

Here is a video of the whole process for Aalto computers. 

<iframe src="https://aalto.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=6760d89f-464c-4703-aa65-af970158adf5&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=true&captions=true&interactivity=all" width="100%" height="480" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

You can also follow the text instructions below.

#### 1. Install Python 3.9

1. Open the Microsoft Store
2. Search for Python 3.9
3. Install the Python 3.9 version that comes up

#### 2. Install Mediapipe for Python

1. Open the Windows Comman Prompt
2. Type `pip3.9 install mediapipe`
3. After a couple of minutes, you should see a message saying that everything has been installed successfully.
4. In order to know where the computer installs the package, type `pip3.9 show mediapipe`. Copy the folder for `Location:`. **Note that you can copy text in the Command Prompt by selecting the text and right-clicking the mouse.**

#### 3. Make Mediapipe available in TouchDesigner

1. Open TouchDesigner
2. Open `Preferences` (alt + p)
3. Select the folder icon for Python 64-bit Module Path
4. Select the folder you found out in the previous step (or copy-paste the path)
5. Click `Save` and close the Preferences window
6. Restart TouchDesigner
7. Open  `Dialogs-->Textport and DATs`
8. Type `import mediapipe as mp` and press enter
9. Then type `print(dir(mp.solutions))` and press enter
10. You should get something like this

```python
python >>> import mediapipe as mp
python >>> print(dir(mp.solutions))
['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__',
'__path__', '__spec__', 'download_utils', 'drawing_styles', 'drawing_utils', 'face_detection',
'face_mesh', 'face_mesh_connections', 'hands', 'hands_connections', 'holistic', 'mediapipe',
'objectron', 'pose', 'pose_connections', 'selfie_segmentation']
python >>> 
```

If you see a similar response, you have successfully installed mediapipe on your computer and it's ready to be used with TouchDesigner.

### MacOS (Silicon)

If you have an Apple computer with the new M-series chip, follow these instructions.

#### 1. Install pyenv

There are many ways of installing Python for macOS. My recommendation would be to install pyenv which then allows you to easily install and control multiple Python versions.

[Follow the installation instructions in GitHub](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)

#### 2. Install the Correct Version of Python

Once you have pyenv installed, you can install Python. TouchDesigner comes with Python built-in. The current version is Python 3.9.5 (January 2023, TouchDesigner version 2022.31030). You need to install a matching version on your computer to be able to setup Mediapipe for Python.

1. Use pyen to install Python version 3.9.5 (or any 3.9. version) `pyenv install 3.9.5`
2. Set you python to use this installed version `pyenv global 3.9.5`
3. Check that everything is in order `pyenv versions`

#### 2. Install Mediapipe for Python

1. Open the Terminal
2. Type `pip install --upgrade --user mediapipe-silicon`
3. After a couple of minutes, you should see a message saying that everything has been installed successfully.
4. In order to know where the computer installs the package, type `pip show mediapipe-silicon`. Copy the folder for `Location:`.

#### 3. Make Mediapipe available in TouchDesigner

1. Open TouchDesigner
2. Open `Preferences` (alt + p)
3. Select the folder icon for Python 64-bit Module Path
4. Select the folder you found out in the previous step (or copy-paste the path)
5. Click `Save` and close the Preferences window
6. Restart TouchDesigner
7. Open  `Dialogs-->Textport and DATs`
8. Type `Ã¬mport mediapipe as mp` and press enter
9. Then type `print(dir(mp.solutions))` and press enter
10. You should get something like this

```python
python >>> import mediapipe as mp
python >>> print(dir(mp.solutions))
['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__',
'__path__', '__spec__', 'download_utils', 'drawing_styles', 'drawing_utils', 'face_detection',
'face_mesh', 'face_mesh_connections', 'hands', 'hands_connections', 'holistic', 'mediapipe',
'objectron', 'pose', 'pose_connections', 'selfie_segmentation']
python >>> 
```

If you see a similar response, you have successfully installed mediapipe on your computer and it's ready to be used with TouchDesigner.
