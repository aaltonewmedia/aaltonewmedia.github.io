## Questions to think about

- Who is the artist in the AI art era?
- Many well-know artists have outsourced the actual material craft of their artworks to other people for decades ([Warhol's Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory), [Jeff Koons](https://www.thecollector.com/how-does-jeff-koons-make-his-art/)). What are the differences of this approach to using an AI system to create the work?
- Is it ethical to train AI models without the consent of the artists who created the original artworks?
- Are AI generators democratizing art? Or are they killing all meaning from making art and exploiting humans?
- Who is benefiting from all of this?
- Explore communities of AI art and "traditional" art. Note the toxicity in both towards each other.
