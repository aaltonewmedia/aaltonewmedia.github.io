# How to do things in the future NM Portal

---

Notes:

- Hugo cannot support dynamic content, nor first party user auth. A Different service such as netlify could be used, but will need a cms/ compiler to deliver the pre-rendered user-specific pages

- Aalto blog is not a viable option because it has zero customisation, no consistent way of maintaining parent-child pages relationship, and it I will be difficult to embed JS

- Wordpress Multisite can support parent-child and multi-domain relationships, however it would depend up to Aalto IT to allow it to have plugins and users
