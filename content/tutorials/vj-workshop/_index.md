## What is VJing?

VJing, or video jockeying, is a form of live performance art that involves the manipulation and projection of visual content in synchronization with music or other audio. The origins of VJing can be traced back to the 1960s, when experimental filmmakers began to incorporate live video mixing into their performances. Visuals can complement the music by providing an additional layer of sensory stimulation. They can also help to create a more immersive environment for the audience, and can be used to convey a specific mood or emotion that complements the music. However, it wasn't until the 1980s and the rise of electronic dance music that VJing began to gain widespread popularity.

In the early days of VJing, the technology was relatively primitive, with VJs using analog video mixers and simple effects processors to create their visuals. However, with the advent of digital technology in the 1990s, VJing began to evolve rapidly. VJs now had access to powerful software tools that allowed them to create complex, layered visuals in real time, and to synchronize their visuals with music and other audio.

[![Old School](/images/tutorials/vj/djspook.jpg)](/images/tutorials/vj/djspook.jpg)

Today, VJing work in a variety of contexts, from nightclubs and music festivals to art galleries and museums. They use a wide range of tools and techniques to create their visuals, from custom software and hardware to off-the-shelf products like Resolume and TouchDesigner. More and more the live between VJing and other forms of live performance art, such as DJing and live coding, is becoming blurred.

## All Reactive, All Realtime

Loops are often used in VJing because they provide a reliable and predictable visual element that can be synchronized with the music. However, relying solely on loops can limit the creative potential of a VJ performance. Moving away from loops can involve incorporating more interactive and generative elements into the performance. This can include using sensors or cameras to capture live input from the audience or the environment, and using that input to generate visuals in real-time.

### Generative Art

Generative art can be used in contemporary VJing to create unique and dynamic visuals that respond to live input from the audience or the environment. Generative art involves the use of algorithms and rules to create art that is constantly evolving and changing. These visuals that are synchronized with the music or other audio, and that respond to live input from sensors or cameras. Similarly, these visuals can be unique and unpredictable. This can help to create a sense of excitement and anticipation among the audience, as they never know what to expect from the visuals. Additionally, generative art can be used to create visuals that are more organic and natural, as they are not limited to the use of pre-made loops or static images.

### Corruption Art

Data moshing is a technique that involves intentionally corrupting the data of a video file to create visual artifacts and glitches. This technique can be used in VJing to create unique and dynamic visuals that are not possible with traditional video editing techniques.

Data moshing can push forward the aesthetics of VJing by introducing a new visual language that is not limited to traditional video editing techniques. It can create a sense of unpredictability and excitement among the audience, as they never know what to expect from the visuals. Some tools like EBSynth, Supermosh, MadPixelSort can achieve different corruption styles.

### Live Coding

Live coding is a technique that involves writing and modifying code in real-time during a performance. In the context of VJing, live coding can be used to create and manipulate visuals in real-time, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive performance.Additionally, live coding can be used to create custom software tools and effects that are tailored to the specific needs of a performance.

## Improvisation

### Odd Setups

As a VJ, you can experience a wide range of setups, from small underground clubs to massive theaters with hundreds of speakers and large screens. In smaller venues, you may be working with limited equipment and space, requiring you to be creative with your setup and use of technology. You may need to work with a small table in the back of a corner, or even just a laptop and a projector. In larger venues, you may have access to more advanced equipment, such as multiple projectors, LED screens, and high-end audio systems.

Regardless of the setup, a VJ must be fluent in both the technology and aesthetics of their craft. They must be able to adapt to the environment and work with the equipment available to them. For example, in a small club, a VJ may need to use creative techniques to make the most of limited space and equipment. They may need to use projection mapping to create the illusion of a larger screen, or use generative art to create dynamic visuals that don't require a large screen.

[![Venue](/images/tutorials/vj/venue.jpeg)](/images/tutorials/vj/venue.jpeg)

In larger venues, a VJ may need to work with multiple projectors and screens, and synchronize their visuals with a complex audio system. They may need to work closely with the sound engineer to ensure that the visuals and audio are perfectly synchronized. They may also need to create custom content that is tailored to the specific needs of the performance, such as creating visuals that respond to the music or the audience.

### Guerilla Projection

Guerrilla projection is a technique that involves projecting images or videos onto public spaces without permission. This technique has been used by VJs and new media artists to create temporary installations that challenge the traditional boundaries of public and private space. Guerrilla projections can be used to create immersive and interactive experiences that engage the audience and transform the way they perceive their sometimes overlooked regular enviroment.

## More than Rectangles

Projection mapping is a technique that allows for the projection of images onto non-traditional surfaces, such as buildings, sculptures, and other objects. This technique allows for the creation of immersive and interactive experiences that can transform the way we perceive our environment.

One of the benefits of projection mapping is that it allows for the creation of large-scale installations that can be viewed from a distance. This makes it ideal for use in public spaces, such as city squares, where it can be used to create a sense of community and engagement. In addition to projection mapping, large screen projections and light installations are also becoming increasingly popular. These installations can be used to create stunning visual displays that can be viewed from a distance, as it allows for the creation of immersive and interactive experiences that can transform the way we perceive our environment.
