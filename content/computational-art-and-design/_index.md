# Computational Art and Design

## Learning Outcomes

## Tools

The programming language we use on this course is JavaScript. More specifically, we use a creative coding library called p5.js

- [p5.js website](https://p5js.org/)


Whenever you work with your own code, I recommend that you edit it in the official p5.js editor or setup a local testing environment for yourself using Visual Studio Code or any other text editor. These are some recommended options on how to work with your own code:

- p5.js Editor
- Open Processing
- CodePen
- [How to setup Visual Studio Code for p5.j5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJw0SyKO9IU)



On some pages I use this interactive p5js-widget that allows you to play with the code right here as you go through the examples and materials:

{% include p5js-widget.html width=400 height=400 %}
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  circle(200, 200, 300);
}
</script>

The widget does not work so well for more complex programs or sketches where I want to use some other libraries. Therefore, I sometimes embed example code using Open Processing. You can edit the code with this as well.

Sometimes I also just link to the p5.js editor or embed the p5js editor itself:
