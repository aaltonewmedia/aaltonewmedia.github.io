## Academic Year 2022–2023

In autumn 2022, our major will be part of the new Master's Programme in Art & Media. I am using this website also as a way to communicate the changes in the new curriculum and degree structure in a transparent way.

The major is also going to have an updated name (New Media). This name change for the major is mainly cosmetic, the removal of the words "Design" and "Production" does not mean that those things would not be part of the studies. Leaving the name more open is in my opinion (*Matti*) more inclusive than exclusive. We deal with New Media from a wide perspective that includes art, design, technology, theory, research, and practice.

## List of courses in the *new* New Media major

Below is a list of all the new courses organized by our new major. This list does not include courses from the other majors of the Aalto Media Lab or from the new MA Programme in Art & Media. Full course lists will be published in Into when they are officially approved. This site is more of a direct communication channel from the New Media major to the students.

**Please note!**  
This website will only have detailed course materials for courses where Matti Niinimäki is the responsible teacher. Other lecturers and professors will use MyCourses or other platforms for their course materials. I will link to them from the list if available.
