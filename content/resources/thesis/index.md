Is Matti your supervisor or advisor for your thesis? This is a basic guide for how to complete your thesis. Remember that each thesis is unique and you will have to adapt these resources and general instructions to fit your specific topic and methods.

---

## Timeline

I would recommend making a timeline for your thesis. Start from the final submission date and go backwards from there.

{{<hint warning>}}

Note that the deadlines at the end of the semester are scheduled during the faculty holidays. This means that the last weeks will be **completely independent work for you. There will be no meetings or comment rounds available during that time.** Please read that sentence again and plan your thesis schedule accordingly.

In 2024, these dates are:

- 31.7.2024
  - **Send you final draft for comments latest on 17.6.2024**
- 31.12.2024
  - **Send you final draft for comments latest on 16.12.2024**

## How to Get Started?

## Thesis Types

You can find starting points for some of the different types of theses that I generally supervise/advise.

{{<hint info>}}
Note the keywords and types of theses that are highlighted green. If you cannot find the type of thesis that you are working on from this page, it is very likely that Matti is not a very good choice as your supervisor/advisor. Consider approaching someone else.

### Practice-Based or Practice-Led Research

{{<hint info>}}
Your identity:
- This approach is very suitable if you don't clearly categorize your professional identity. You are comfortable navigating the world as a hybrid artist-designer-technologist-researcher. Your practice operates in this fuzzy space of different disciplines.

Your thesis:
- Includes a creative outcome that is an artefact (digital media, software, interactive object etc.) or something more ephemeral (site-specific installation, performance).
- Interactive art
- Experimental interactive and/or immersive experiences
- New instruments/controllers for performative works (audio-visual performances)
- Developing new tools for computational art or design
- Critical Making
{{</hint>}}

If Matti is your thesis advisor or supervisor, you are most likely embarking on creating artistic or other type of practice-based research. This approach is very well suited for interactive art, as the field exists somewhere between art, design, and technology. It is also very commonly used in the field and has been defined by practitioners working in interactive art.

#### Guide by Linda Candy

- [Please refer to the guide written by Linda Candy](https://www.creativityandcognition.com/practice-based-research/). You can find the PDF at the bottom of that page.
  - Page 7 of the guide has a thesis outline that should act as a template for your thesis. Follow that and you will complete a successful thesis. Adjustments might be needed for your specific research, but use this as a starting point.

### Artistic Research

{{<hint info>}}
Your identity:
- There is no ambiguity about your professional identity. You see yourself as **an artist**.

Your thesis:
- Is an artwork (no matter what the exact medium is) and the artistic process is the research process itself.
- You are interested in the meaning of your work, your artistic methods, and critically reflecting on both.
{{</hint>}}

If your want to frame your thesis specifically as **artistic research**, the basic practice-based research could also be used, but you can also find some more specific resources centered around art.

### Design Research

{{<hint info>}}
Your identity:
- There is no ambiguity about your professional identity. You see yourself as **a designer**.

Your thesis:
- Problem-oriented
- Speculative Design (this one could also be in the practice-based research category)
{{</hint>}}

Is your thesis specifically framed as **design**, you should 

#### Research through Design (RtD)

RtD has many overlaps with practice-based or practice-led research but is more suitable approach if you identify yourself specifically as a designer. It is a more structured, systematic, and defined approach compared to artistic or practice-based reserch, where creative exploration has more space and there might not be a specific problem that is being solved.
